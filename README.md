# Wasmcloud API Interfaces

## Smithy IDLs and shared libraries

Each interface is defined in a file with the `.smithy` extension. If
the folder contains a `codegen.toml` file,
a library and/or html documentation can be
automatically generated from the `.smithy` file. 

More information on code
generation and the `codegen.toml` files is in the [weld
crate](https://github.com/wasmcloud/weld)

The `docs` folder in this repository is published to github pages at
[Wasmcloud Interfaces](https://wasmcloud.github.io/interfaces/), and
contains copies of the interfaces available for direct download, and
html generated documentation.
