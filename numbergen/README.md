# Number Generator
This is the interface definition for the wasmCloud built-in interface that is guaranteed to be supported by all runtime hosts, `wasmcloud:builtin:numbergen`.

## Implementations
There are no external implementations of this provider as all implementations of the `wasmcloud:builtin:numbergen` contract are built directly into the host runtime(s).
