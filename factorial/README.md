# Factorial Interface
This is the definition for the interface used for examples and illustrations with the contract ID of `wasmcloud:example:factorial`.

This is an interface for a simple service that calculates the factorial of a whole number. 

**NOTE** that this is just an example, and we would not recommend a real-world production scenario where you use an interface and accompanying capability provider for factorial calculations.
