# wasmCloud Control Interface

This is the control interface for interacting with the **lattice** by virtue of wasmCloud hosts listening on the appropriate control topics. 

This API is used by tools such as `wash`, the wasmCloud dashboard web UI, and any other custom consumers. It is **not** meant to be used by actors or capability providers.

The generated library for using this interface via Rust is currently located 
in the
[control-interface](https://github.com/wasmcloud/control-interface)
repository.
