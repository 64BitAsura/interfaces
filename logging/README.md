# wasmCloud Builtin Logging Interface
This interface defines the wasmCloud built-in logging interface (`wasmcloud:builtin:logging`) that comes with each of our supported host runtimes. If you are looking for a different kind of logging, then that will likely be covered in a different interface.

## Implementations

There are no external implementations for this provider as they are built directly into the host runtime.
